A prediction Model of Season Flu Vaccine uptake

## Introduction

Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a respiratory illness that can have severe consequences, especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly, young children, and those with pre-existing conditions. The annual flu vaccine is recommended to reduce the severity of the flu and its complications, taking around two weeks to provide protection through antibody production. The H1N1 pandemic, originating in the United States in 2009, caused a significant global impact and resulted in numerous deaths. The virus primarily affected young children and middle-aged adults, while older individuals seemed to have some immunity due to prior exposure. A vaccine for H1N1 was developed and the pandemic was declared over in 2010, although H1N1 continues to circulate as a seasonal flu strain.

## Problem Statement

This project aims to improve the accuracy of predicting H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccination rates by considering individual background and behavioral patterns. Current approaches lack comprehensive models that can account for the various factors influencing vaccine uptake, resulting in limited effectiveness in public health strategies. The project intends to develop a robust predictive model by incorporating variables such as demographics, socio-economic factors, medical history, behavior, and attitudes towards vaccination. The goal is to provide actionable insights for public health professionals and policymakers, enabling them to optimize vaccination campaigns, allocate resources efficiently, and create targeted interventions. Ultimately, the project seeks to reduce the burden of influenza, safeguard public health, and enhance overall community well-being.

## Main Objectives

- Develop a predictive model that can estimate the seasonal flu vaccine uptake by utilizing individual characteristic and behavioral patterns.
- Provide insights into the likelihood of individuals receiving the flu vaccine during specific seasons.
- Uncover valuable patterns and associations between various factors and vaccine uptake.
- Create an accurate and reliable model that can assist in predicting and promoting flu vaccine uptake

## Metric for Success

The project's success criterion is to identify a model with the highest accuracy. The desired accuracy level for success is set at 80%.

## Data Description

The datasets used for this project were downloaded from Kaggle. 
It contains information on the social,economic and demographic backgrounds of the respondents as well as their opinions on the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines.
The training data has 26707 rows and 36 columns

## Data Preparation

During the initial phase, the data was loaded and evaluated, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. 
In the process, it became apparent that there were numerous missing values in the dataset, which were addressed by replacing them with suitable values. 
To facilitate ordinal encoding, the data types of all the categorical features in the dataset were modified. 
This transformation was a necessary step in preparing the data for modeling purposes.

## Modelling

The dataset was divided into two sets: the training dataset and the test dataset. The baseline model was established by employing a Decision Tree.
Additionally the following datasets were used:
- RandomForest, 
- GradientBoostingClassifier, 
- ADABoosting, 
- XGBoosting


## Model Evaluation

The model selection was based on the following criteria:
- Model Train and Test Accuracy.
- Cross Validation Accuracy.
- Log Loss.

## Conclusion

- The best model is the GradientBoostingClassifier with train accuracy of 79.3% and a test accuracy of 78.7%.
- It has a Cross validation accuracy of 78.30%, this means that the model is able to correctly and accurately classify 78.30% of observations.

Although the desired accuracy of 80% was not achieved, the project is deemed successful due to the extensive efforts invested in
refining the models and minimizing noise. 
while the dataset provides intriguing insights, its biases, particularly the overrepresentation of certain demographics, need to be considered. Striving for a more balanced dataset and implementing a pipeline approach with pickling capabilities will contribute to generating more accurate and efficient results in future analyses.

## Recommendations

- Collect a more diverse and balanced dataset by including a wider range of demographic groups.

- Address potential biases in the models by employing techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or weighted loss functions.

- Investigate the impact of identified predictors, such as race, to understand underlying factors and ensure fair decision-making.

- Gather external data from diverse sources to validate the conclusions and enhance their generalizability.

- Clearly communicate limitations, biases, and specific applicability of the models to ensure responsible use of the findings.
